BUDGET OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT

AI Cost Management:
- Route to cheapest capable model first
- Cache frequent queries to reduce API calls
- Batch similar requests when possible
- Set token limits by task type
- Monitor daily spend
- Alert at 50% and 80% of monthly budget

Model Cost Tiers:
- Low cost: DeepSeek, Grok (prefer for routine tasks)
- Medium cost: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude (use for quality-critical tasks)
- High cost: K1/Reasoning models (use sparingly for strategic decisions)

Tool Stack Optimization:
- Prefer native n8n nodes over paid integrations
- Use free tiers where sufficient
- Consolidate overlapping tools
- Annual vendor review for cost vs value

Marketing Efficiency:
- Focus on high-ROI channels
- Track CAC by channel weekly
- Pause underperformers quickly
- Reinvest savings in winners

Operational Efficiency:
- Automate repetitive tasks (target: 80% automation)
- Reduce manual handoffs
- Optimize shift clustering for travel costs
- Improve fill rate to reduce acquisition cost per shift

Cost Tracking Requirements:
- Log every API call: model, tokens, cost, task type
- Weekly cost report by model and task category
- Monthly review of cost-performance ratio
- Quarterly optimization based on data
