LEAD GENERATION AND SALES CONTEXT

Lead Scoring Model:
- Intent signals (40%): Pages visited, time on site, return visits
- Engagement (30%): Email opens/clicks, WhatsApp replies, form submissions
- Firmographics (20%): Company size, industry, city
- Behavior (10%): Call outcomes, meeting attendance

Routing Rules:
- Score ≥80 (Hot): Immediate call within 5 minutes + WhatsApp
- Score 50-79 (Warm): SDR sequence within 1 hour
- Score <50 (Nurture): Email drip + retargeting

Lead Sources: Inbound (forms, chat, phone), Outbound (KvK, Google Maps, job boards), Enrichment (company data scraping), AI qualification

SDR Sequences:
- Day 1: Personalized email with company reference
- Day 3: LinkedIn connection
- Day 5: Follow-up with case study
- Day 7: WhatsApp (if opted in)
- Day 10: Final email with calendar link
Rotate angles: speed, compliance, cost, reliability

Sales Playbooks:

- Objections: Price, satisfaction, trust concerns
- ROI math: No-show costs + management time vs. fee
- Closing: Trial shift offer, volume discount

CRM: Accounts → Contacts → Deals → Shifts → Invoices → Tickets → Consents (no orphans, audit fields, PII flagged)
